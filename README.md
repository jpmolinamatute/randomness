# Random of Randomness #

Welcome! this is a personal project to create & update a playlist with random songs for Spotify.

I had two reasons to create this app:

1. My liked playlist occupies way more than the storage capacity in my phone.
2. If I wanted to download songs I needed to create/update a playlist manually.

This App uses OAuth to authenticate the user against the Spotify server and then uses REST API call to create & update a specific playlist with random songs. Every time the app is run, a new set of songs replace all previous songs in this specific playlist.

In order to use this app, you also need a Spotify developer access keys.

If you have any question, please open a ticket in the issues sections.
